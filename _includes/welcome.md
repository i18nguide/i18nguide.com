# Welcome

This website aims to be an easy-to-read, quick reference for internationalization
best practices and authoritative content around the Web.

_There is no canonical way to international software_.
At some point you will want your software to go further and you'll start
internationalizing it. It's hard to know which way to do it because there are so
many ways. This website will  not tell you which tools to use, but
instead offer suggestions for multiple options, when possible explaining the differences
in approach and use-case.

This is a living document and will continue to be updated with more helpful information
and examples as they become available.

## Translations

language so it helps more people building international software.
